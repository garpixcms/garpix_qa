# Garpix QA

Please use https://github.com/garpixcms/eqator

Checking the Django project for quality. It can be convenient if you include it in CI.

Used packages: 

* [django unittest](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/overview/) - unit testing in Django.
* [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) - linter of source code.
* [radon](https://pypi.org/project/radon/) - tool that computes various metrics from the source code.
* [bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) - a security linter from PyCQA.

## Quickstart

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install garpix_qa
```

Add the `garpix_qa` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'garpix_qa',
]
```

To use Lighthouse scoring, install `Lighthouse CI` with `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g @lhci/cli
```

Check your project:

```bash
python manage.py qa
```

Check your project with Lighthouse CI:

(requires Lighthouse CI installed)

```bash
python manage.py qa -a
```

```bash
python manage.py qa --all
```

Optionally, do not save Lighthouse CI report files:

```bash
python manage.py qa --all --clear-reports
```

Check your project with all logs:

```bash
python manage.py qa --verbose
```
